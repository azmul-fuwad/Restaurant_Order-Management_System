# 🍽️ Restaurant Order & Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Restaurant Order & Management System** is a console-based application developed in **C#** to demonstrate the practical implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. The system provides separate functionalities for customers and admin users, enabling smooth restaurant order processing and management.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Apply core OOP concepts in a real-world application
* Build a multi-user restaurant ordering system
* Allow customers to place orders easily
* Enable admin to manage menu items and monitor orders
